# Z2Pack
is a tool for calculating topological invariants on
first-principles (z2pack.fp) and tight-binding (z2pack.tb) systems.

It uses the method described in
[this paper](http://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.83.235401)
to calculate the Z2 topological invariant.

Overlap matrices are calculated either directly (for tb) or via
the Wannier90 code package (fp).
