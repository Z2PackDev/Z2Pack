A first-principles calculation with Quantum ESPRESSO
====================================================
The following is a very basic calculation of Z2 invariants using **Quantum
ESPRESSO** for Bismuth. The complete example (including input files)
can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/Z2PackDev/Z2Pack/tree/master/examples/fp/Bi_qe>`_.
