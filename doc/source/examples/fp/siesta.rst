A first-principles calculation with SIESTA
==========================================
The following is a very basic calculation of Z2 invariants using **SIESTA**
for a **generic system**. Before running this calculation, an SCF run is
required to create generate Hamiltonian and overlap matrices.

A complete example (including input files) for monolayer Bismuthen (111)
can be found on `GitHub <https://github.com/juijan/Z2Pack/tree/z2pack-withSIESTAexample/examples/fp/siesta>`_.
