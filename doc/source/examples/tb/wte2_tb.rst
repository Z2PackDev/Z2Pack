Chirality of a Weyl point (tight-binding)
=========================================

In this example, the chirality of a Weyl point is calculated for a tight-binding model of WTe\ :sub:`2`. This is done by calculating the Chern number on a sphere surrounding the Weyl point.

The Chern number is a measure for the flux of Berry curvature, thus it can be used to determine if the Weyl point is a source or sink of Berry curvature (i.e., determine its chirality).
