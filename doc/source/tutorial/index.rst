Tutorial
========
This tutorial will take you through all the basic steps of using Z2Pack. Since Z2Pack is a **Python library**, you might need some knowledge of Python along the way. If you've never used Python before, you might want to check out the excellent `Python Tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html>`_ first.

If you've used a previous version of Z2Pack, you should probably read the :ref:`what's new <z2pack_tutorial_new>` section first. Otherwise you can skip ahead and start with the :ref:`installation instructions <z2pack_tutorial_installation>`.
