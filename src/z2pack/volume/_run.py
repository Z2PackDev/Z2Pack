    Calculates the Wannier charge centers for a given system and volume.

    * automated convergence in string direction
    * automated check for distance between gap and wcc â†’ add string
    * automated convergence check w.r.t. movement of the WCC between
      different k-strings.

    :param system:      System for which the WCC should be calculated.
    :type system:       :class:`z2pack.system.EigenstateSystem` or :class:`z2pack.system.OverlapSystem`.

    :param volume:      Volume in which the WCC / Wilson loops should be calculated. The argument should be a callable which parametrizes the volume :math:`\mathbf{k}(t_1, t_2, t_3)`, in reduced coordinates. It should take three arguments (``float``) and return a nested list of ``float`` describing the points in k-space. Note that the surface must be closed at least along the :math:`t_3` - direction, that is :math:`\mathbf{k}(t_1, t_2, 0) = \mathbf{k}(t_1, t_2, 1) + \mathbf{G}`, where :math:`\mathbf{G}` is an inverse lattice vector.

    :param pos_tol:     The maximum movement of a WCC for the iteration w.r.t. the number of k-points in a single string to converge. The iteration can be turned off by setting ``pos_tol=None``.
    :type pos_tol:      float

    :param gap_tol:     Determines the smallest distance between a gap and its neighbouring WCC for the gap check to be satisfied. The distance must be larger than ``gap_tol`` times the size of the gap. This check is performed only for the largest gap in each string of WCC. The check can be turned off by setting ``gap_tol=None``.
    :type gap_tol:      float

    :param move_tol:    Determines the largest possible movement between WCC of neighbouring strings for the move check to be satisfied. The movement can be no larger than ``move_tol`` time the size of the largest gap between two WCC (from the two neighbouring strings, the smaller value is chosen). The check can be turned off by setting ``move_tol=None``.
    :type move_tol:    float

    :param num_lines:     Initial number of strings.
    :type num_lines:      int

    :param num_surfaces:  Initial number of surfaces.
    :type num_surfaces:   int

    :param min_neighbour_dist:  Minimum distance between two strings (no new strings will be added, even if the gap check or move check fails).
    :type min_neighbour_dist:   float

    :param iterator:    Generator for the number of points in a k-point string. The iterator should also take care of the maximum number of iterations. It is needed even when ``pos_tol=None``, to provide a starting value.

    :param save_file:   Path to a file where the result should be stored.
    :type save_file:    str

    :param init_result: Initial result which is loaded at the start of the calculation.
    :type init_result:  :class:`.LineResult`

    :param load:        Determines whether the initial result is loaded from ``save_file``.
    :type load:         bool

    :param load_quiet:  Determines whether errors / inexistent files are ignored when loading from ``save_file``
    :type load_quiet:   bool

    :param serializer:  Serializer which is used to save the result to file. Valid options are ``msgpack``, :py:mod:`json` and :py:mod:`pickle`. By default (``serializer='auto'``), the serializer is inferred from the file ending. If this fails, :py:mod:`json` is used.
    :type serializer:   module

    :returns:   :class:`VolumeResult` instance.

    Example usage:

    .. code:: python

        system = ... # Refer to the various ways of creating a System instance.
        result = z2pack.volume.run(
            system=system,
            surface=lambda t1, t2, t3: [t1, t2, t3]

        print(result.wcc) # Prints a nested list of WCC (a list for each surface, which each contains a list of WCC for each line).
