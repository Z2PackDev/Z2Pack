class System(EigenstateSystem):
    r"""
    This class is used when the system can be explicitly described as a matrix Hamiltonian :math:`\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{k})`.

    :param hamilton: A function taking the wavevector ``k`` (``list`` of length 3) as an input and returning the matrix Hamiltonian.
    :type hamilton: collections.abc.Callable

    :param dim:     Dimension of the system.
    :type dim:      int

    :param pos: Positions of the orbitals w.r.t the reduced unit cell.
        Per default, all orbitals are put at the origin.
    :type pos: list

    :param bands: Specifies either the number of occupied bands (if it is an integer) or which bands should be taken into consideration (if it is a list of indices). If no value is given, half the given bands are considered.
    :type bands: :py:class:`int` or :py:class:`list`

    :param hermitian_tol:   Maximum absolute value in the difference between the Hamiltonian and its hermitian conjugate. Use ``hermitian_tol=None`` to deactivate the test entirely.
    :type hermitian_tol:    float
