    r"""
    This class is used when the system can be explicitly described as a matrix Hamiltonian :math:`\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{k})`.

    :param hamilton: A function taking the wavevector ``k`` (``list`` of length 3) as an input and returning the matrix Hamiltonian.
    :type hamilton: collections.abc.Callable

    :param dim:     Dimension of the system.
    :type dim:      int

    :param pos: Positions of the orbitals w.r.t the reduced unit cell.
        Per default, all orbitals are put at the origin.
    :type pos: list

    :param bands: Specifies either the number of occupied bands (if it is an integer) or which bands should be taken into consideration (if it is a list of indices). If no value is given, half the given bands are considered.
    :type bands: :py:class:`int` or :py:class:`list`

    :param hermitian_tol:   Maximum absolute value in the difference between the Hamiltonian and its hermitian conjugate. Use ``hermitian_tol=None`` to deactivate the test entirely.
    :type hermitian_tol:    float

    :param basis_overlap: A function taking the wavevector ``k`` (``list`` of length 3) as an input and returning the overlap matrix between the basis vectors w.r.t which the Hamiltonian is defined. If no value is given, the basis is assumed to be orthonormal.
    :type basis_overlap: collections.abc.Callable

    :param convention: The convention used for the Hamiltonian, following the `pythtb formalism <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/pythtb/_downloads/pythtb-formalism.pdf>`_. Convention 1 means that the eigenvalues of :math:`\mathcal{H}(\mathbf{k})` are wave vectors :math:`\left|\psi_{n\mathbf{k}}\right>`. With convention 2, they are the cell-periodic Bloch functions :math:`\left|u_{n\mathbf{k}}\right>`.
    :type convention: int

    :param check_periodic: Evaluate the Hamiltonian at :math:`\{0, 1\}^d` as a simple check if it is periodic. Note that this does not work if the Hamiltonian is written such that the eigenstates acquire a phase when being translated by a lattice vector.
    :type check_periodic: bool
